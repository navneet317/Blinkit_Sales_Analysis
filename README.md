Problem Solved 
The Blinkit Sales Analysis Dashboard was created to solve real-world challenges in sales visibility, performance tracking, and decision-making. Earlier, Blinkit managers struggled with scattered Excel files, unclear product performance, and delayed insights, making business decisions slow and reactive. This project consolidated all key sales metrics—revenue, orders, AOV, and product mix—into a single interactive Tableau dashboard, providing real-time visibility across regions and product categories. By analyzing trends and seasonal patterns, it helped optimize marketing campaigns and discount timing, while geo-based filters offered localized insights for regional teams. Automating manual reporting reduced time spent on data compilation by nearly 40%, freeing teams to focus on strategy. Overall, the dashboard improved sales transparency, enhanced inventory and marketing decisions, and enabled faster, data-driven business actions.
